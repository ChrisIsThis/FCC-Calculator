## Calculator

### Live Demo
[See it live here](https://chrisisthis.github.io/FCC-Calculator/)

### Description
This is [one of the FCC Advanced Front End Development Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator). It is a simple four-function calculator. The primary operation hinges around an array. The array, which is initially empty, is displayed on the bottom row as a joined string. Clicking numbers/operations adds to the array, clicking "equals" joins and evals the array and displays it on the top row as the result. AC clears the entire array, while CE clears the most recent.

### Challenges 

The primary challenge here was preventing unacceptable user behavior (e.g. a number with two decimals, 2.4.5 or two consecutive mathematical operations, 4 * / 3). 

### Known Issues
- [ ] slight text overlap of div in result
- [ ] Non-mobile responsive
- [ ] too much math on display screen--should run off left side of screen, instead hides on right
- [ ] long negative values ('-' adds one too many characters)

### Future Updates
- [ ] Mobile Friendly version
- [ ] Key stroke input
- [ ] Additional functions?
- [ ] Moar Doge-ification!
